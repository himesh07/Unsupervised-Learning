# Unsupervised Learning on Credit Approval Dataset
Welcome to the "Unsupervised Learning on Credit Approval Dataset" project repository. This project delves into the intriguing world of unsupervised machine learning techniques applied to a credit card approval dataset. By harnessing the power of exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering algorithms, this project aims to predict credit card approvals and uncover underlying patterns within the data.

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository, focusing on credit card applications. Our journey begins with data preprocessing, where missing values are handled and categorical features are transformed into a numerical format. The process of exploratory data analysis follows, allowing us to visualize feature distributions and gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

The pivotal concept of dimensionality reduction comes into play through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which facilitates the reduction of feature dimensions while preserving crucial information. Unsupervised learning truly takes the spotlight with the application of KMeans Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The KMeans algorithm emerges as a primary contender, enabling the creation of clusters that reveal inherent patterns within the data.

Our exploration culminates in the visualization of clusters, where we use joint plots and swarm plots to depict the arrangement of data points within clusters. Performance evaluation metrics such as the Adjusted Rand Index, Silhouette Score, and Calinski Harabasz Score provide a comprehensive understanding of our models' accuracy, separation quality, and cluster compactness.
